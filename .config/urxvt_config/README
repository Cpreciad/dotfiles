Lemme Tell you sum

this is the urxvt terminal!

here is where I store all of the different configurations I want to have.

These are tried and true to work with urxvt(eg. transparency and correct collors)

To change it: 

This folder contains a directory with different terminal templates for urxvt. 

to change format, do this in the current folder:
				
				> cat terminal_scheme{0-...} > ~/.Xresources
				> xrdb ~/.Xresources
